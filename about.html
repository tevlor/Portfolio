        <h1>I am Taylor Stewart.</h1>
        <p>I am currently a student at Wake Technical Community College where I am pursuing an associate degree in Advertising and Graphic Design. While in high school, I had the opportunity to take classes involving Photoshop and other Adobe applications. This is where my interest grew.</p> 
        <p>  After graduating from high school early, I decided to go straight into college. After some research, I stumbled upon the degree I am working on now, and I knew I made a wonderful choice. </p>
        <p>Though, I do not want to be a graphic designer, I want to be a tattoo artist. Graphic design helps towards this goal as creativity, patience, and initiative are factors of both fields. Even though my future job is not a graphic designer, I still find joy in creating new graphics and designs for others and myself, and I will find myself doing these tasks as a side job.</p>
